# Platzi Challenge - Food Delivery Service App

## The Task
For the next 3 weeks, you'll be creating your very own food delivery application, using the FoodMe open source application.
This application has been around for a long time, and looks like it needs some updates. Using your tech skills, you're going to be able to modernize this application and make it your ideal food delivery service app.

Haven't used a food delivery application before? Some examples include Rappi and UberEats if you'd like to get some ideas for design and features.

Remember: This challenge is meant for developers of all levels, and some of the functionality has been built in to give you a great start. Use the documentation from Angular, Bootstrap, Node, and your favorite resources on HTML, CSS, JavaScript to help you.

## Requirements
- The application must have one restaurant that features food from your country.
- The application must have some design changes from the original application (colors, font, photos for example).
- The application cannot accept American Express cards.
- You must use GitHub Copilot to help you build the application.
- You must instrument your application with New Relic using the Browser Monitoring Guided Install and the Node.js Guided Install.

## Run the application
`npm run start`

## Stop the application
Press `Ctrl` + `C`
